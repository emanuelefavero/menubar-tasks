# MenuBar Tasks

This is an Electron app for Mac OS that allows you to create, manage and display tasks directly in the Mac OS menu bar. It is designed to be minimal, easy to use and lightweight

> Note: Some features are still in development as of this writing, but the core functionality is complete and ready for use

## Features

- Create, edit and delete tasks directly from the menu bar
- Show the last task in the menu bar instead of the icon
- Minimal interface
- Lightweight and fast

## Installation

- Clone the repository and `cd` into the directory
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- Run `npm start` to start the app
- Check your menu bar to see the app in action

> Tip: You can also package the app using `npm run package` to create a standalone app that you can distribute to others. Running `npm run make` will create a distributable package for your OS. You can find the package in the `out` directory
